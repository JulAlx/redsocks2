<b>redsocks2 for OpenWRT</b>

This is a modified version of the original redsocks2. It has been modified to enable the 'HTTPS Proxy' feature by default and consequently 'Shadowsocks' disabled. Can't have both enabled at the same time. "<i>Why?</i>"; don't ask me, speak to its developer!

Compiles as easy as 1, 2, 3!
